You can include any kind of media, text files just need to be in .md

If an entry seems off topic, not faith related or seems to be pushing a specific denominations beliefs very hard it won't be added. But if it is related to wisdom in general it may be approved, because God is wisdom

#### Isaiah 11:2 NIV
The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him—
    the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding,
    the Spirit of counsel and of might,
    the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the Lord—
