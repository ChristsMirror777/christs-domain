# Core Philosophies

This project should be uncensorable. Meaning very difficult to censor or stop the spread of. It should be easy to add too and share

This project is intended to be interacted with in obsidian.md

We aim to operate from The Spirit of Wisdom, which is God. Below is an example of a bible study entry to explain what that means

# God is Wisdom and Lives in us
## Isaiah 11:1-2 NIV
1 A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse;  
    from his roots a Branch will bear fruit.  
2 The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him—  
    the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding,  
    the Spirit of counsel and of might,  
    the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the Lord—

Wisdom is part of The Spirit of The Lord

## Zechariah 4:2-4 NIV
2 He asked me, “What do you see?”
	I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it,  with seven channels to the lamps. 
3 Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”
4 I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
5 He answered, “Do you not know what these are?”
	“No, my lord,” I replied.
6 So he said to me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the Lord Almighty.

The 7 spirits seen in Zechariah's vision are seen as a Menorah
God says "but by my Spirit" these are the same 7 spirits as in Isaiah 11:2 that rest on Jesus in Matthew 3:16

## Matthew 3:16 NIV
1 As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him

## John 14:26 NIV
26 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you

It isn't a stretch to say that the spirit of Counsel, Knowledge, and Wisdom which are part of the 7 spirits of the Lord, that descended on Jesus is the one teaching us and reminding us In John 14:26

So Wisdom is (one part of) The Spirit of God, The Spirit of God is The Holy Spirit, and The Holy Spirit lives in us

## 1 Corinthians 6:19 NIV
19 Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;

Therefore every Christian has access to Wisdom, Counsel and Knowledge by The Holy Spirit. We aim to operate out of this spirit in all we do, and judge entries by it

# Formatting

We urge you to make entries in the above format, however there is no standard.

Names of files should be in lower-case without special carachters (space - and . are permitted)

If you open this file in Obsidian, everything folds nicely. Longer verses fold as well as the verse itself when following the shown markdown standard. Allowing for an easy visual of all supported verses

# Maintainers

New maintainers are selected by the current group of maintainers as worthy based on maintainers discernment and prayer. If the group generally agrees and has all prayed about it, the new maintainer will be added

There is no formal process. Only spirit led selection

# Considerations

We recommend keeping a backup of this repo on an a flash drive or SSD in a safe place to preserve or distribute to a persecuted individual

It would also be very helpful if you hosted this repo on Git Tea and included connection information in the "Git-Tea-Instances" file

All donations made to this ministry will be split between every maintainer equally
You can buy us a coffee at <!--placeholder-->

Please pray for this project, that it would remain pure and truthful, led by the spirit always. If we can have copies of this still around when Christ comes back it would be pretty awesome
